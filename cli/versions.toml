# wasmcp component versions
#
# This file defines the default versions for all wasmcp components.
# Component versions can be updated independently (e.g., for bug fixes).
#
# Interface versions are discovered from the actual components at composition time.
# wac-graph validates that interface versions match exactly during encoding.
