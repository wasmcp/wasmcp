# Continuous Integration workflow for wasmcp
#
# Caching Strategy:
#   - Rust compilation artifacts cached per job (lint, cli, components)
#   - Caches saved on main branch and PRs for fast subsequent runs
#   - Registry index and git dependencies cached globally
#   - Separate cache keys prevent cross-contamination between jobs
#
# Jobs:
#   1. lint: Format and clippy checks on workspace root
#   2. build-cli: Build wasmcp CLI binary (native x86_64-linux)
#   3. security-audit: Check dependencies for known vulnerabilities
#   4. build-components: Build framework components (wasm32-wasip2)
#
# Note: Template tests are in a separate workflow (test-templates.yml) that only
# runs when cli/ files change
