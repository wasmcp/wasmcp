# Ignore RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (Marvin Attack on RSA decryption)
#
# Rationale: This vulnerability affects RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 **decryption** operations where an
# attacker measures timing differences during private key decryption to extract the key.
#
# Our usage is NOT vulnerable because:
# 1. We process JWTs (JSON Web Signatures), not JWEs (JSON Web Encryption)
# 2. JWTs are Base64-encoded + signed, NOT encrypted
# 3. We only perform signature VERIFICATION using RSA public keys
# 4. We never perform decryption operations (we don't have private keys)
# 5. The jsonwebtoken::decode() function verifies signatures, despite the confusing name
#
# RSA operations we use:
# - Signature verification: public key verifies signature created by private key ✓
#
# RSA operations affected by Marvin attack:
# - Decryption: private key decrypts ciphertext encrypted by public key ✗ (we don't do this)
#
# See: https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0071
# See: crates/authorization/src/jwt.rs:115 for our verify implementation
