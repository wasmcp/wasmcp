# Ignore RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (Marvin Attack on RSA decryption)
# Rationale: This vulnerability affects RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 **decryption** operations.
# Our usage of jsonwebtoken only performs RSA **signature verification**, not decryption.
# These are different cryptographic operations - signatures use public key operations,
# while the Marvin attack targets private key decryption timing sidechannels.
# See: https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0071
