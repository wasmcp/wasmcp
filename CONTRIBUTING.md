# Contributing to wasmcp

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Ways to Contribute
- **Report bugs** or request features via [GitHub Issues](../../issues).  
- **Improve documentation** (README, examples, tutorials).  
- **Submit patches** via Pull Requests (PRs).  
- **Propose design changes** via the RFC process.

## Development Setup
1. Clone the repo
2. Install Rust (latest stable with `wasm32-wasip2` target)
3. Install [Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/)
4. Build the CLI: `cd cli && cargo build --release`
5. Run tests: `cargo test`

## Pull Requests
- Small fixes: open a PR directly.  
- Larger changes (new APIs, breaking WIT changes): open an issue first to discuss
  or submit an RFC.  
- All PRs require review by at least one maintainer.  
- Keep commits focused; rebase if necessary before merging.

## RFC Process
For substantial changes (e.g. protocol semantics, new transports), create a PR
adding a markdown doc under `/rfcs`.  
The RFC should describe the motivation, design, and alternatives considered.  
After discussion and approval, the RFC is merged and guides implementation.

## Code of Conduct
